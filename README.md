Smart conveyor belt for detecting the conditions of honey jay using yolov5 and sorting the jars accordingly using esp32 microcontrollers. Every device is connected to the local wifi, which means communication between every device happens wirelessly. 
Three devices are used in this project that are main computer and two esp32 microcontrollers. The main computer(laptop) is used for honey jar recognition. One esp32cam is used for getting camera feed. Real-Time Streaming Protocol(RTSP) is used to send esp32cam feed directly to the main computer. Detection is done on the RTSP feed of esp32cam using yolov5 on the main computer. The second esp32 is used for sorting the jars as per their conditions. Socket programming is used for communication between the python code and second esp32 through local wifi. Messages are sent from the python code to the second esp32 if any anomaly is detected in a honey jar.
